#### Mathematics

The mathematics assessment covers six areas:
1. **Geometry**: The mathematical science of describing the properties of shapes, including straight and curved lines, circles, triangles, rectangles, cubes, and spheres
2. **Lines and Functions**: A function is a relationship between the two variables x and y, and a straight line is the most fundamental example of a function.
3. **Number and Calculation**: The foundation of all of mathematics and science, including economics, finance and banking, medicine, and so many other aspects of our world
4. **Statistics**: The mathematics of turning data (lots of numbers) into useable information.
5. **Variables and Equations**: Algebraic tools that describe quantities and their relationships in more general ways than we can do with numbers alone.
6. **Word Problems**: Real-world problems that can be solved using a variety of mathematical tools.
