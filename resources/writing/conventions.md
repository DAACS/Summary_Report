#### Conventions

In the context of the DAACS writing assessment, conventions refer to the correctness of the spelling, punctuation, and capitalization in the students' essay. The essay that the students wrote should have very few, if any, minor errors of spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, to the extent that almost no editing is needed.

Here are some resources related to conventions that you could recommend to your students:
