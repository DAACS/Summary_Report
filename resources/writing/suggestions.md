#### Suggestions
In the context of the DAACS writing assessment, suggestions refer to the steps students wrote about taking to improve your SRL. The suggestions to which students commit should be logically and explicitly related to the survey results and feedback, and developed in sufficient depth. The feedback students received after taking the SRL survey provides suggestions students can write about. 

Here are some resources related to suggestions that you could recommend to your students:

* Analyzing assignments and thinking rhetorically: https://owl.excelsior.edu/research/assignment-analysis/.

* Talk to someone in your collegeâ€™s writing center about using evidence to support claims.
