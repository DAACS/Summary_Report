#### Cohesion

In the context of the DAACS writing assessment, cohesion refers to the linkage between individual sentences within the paragraphs in students' essays. Individual sentences should be seamlessly linked together so that a reader can see the relationship between the ideas or information in one sentence and those in another sentence. Students might have explicitly linked sentences and ideas using adverbs (e.g., similarly, also, therefore), relative pronouns (e.g., who, that, which), conjunctions (e.g., and, or, while, whereas), and/or the repetition of key words.  

Here are some resources related to conventions that you could recommend to your students:
