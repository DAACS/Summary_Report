#### Language

The language domain assesses students' ability to understand vocabulary items and interpret specific words and phrases as they are used in texts. The primary skills covered by this domain are vocabulary strength; determining the technical, connotative, and figurative meanings of words and phrases; understanding literary devices (e.g., simile, metaphor, imagery, symbolism, personification, alliteration foreshadowing, etc.); and analyzing how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

You might consider recommending the following strategies to your students to improve their language skills:

* Flag difficult vocabulary items and phrases as you read
* Use context clues and word-part clues to help determine what words mean
* Use dictionaries and thesauruses to help determine what words mean
* Identify and look up specialized vocabulary items
* Learn about common literary devices such as simile, metaphor, personification, and hyperbole
* Annotate texts as you read to improve your overall reading comprehension
