#### Purpose

The purpose domain assesses students' ability to identify how context and purpose shape the content and style of a text. The primary skills covered by this domain are identifying authorial point of view and purpose, understanding how considerations about audience shape what and how ideas are presented, and recognizing tone in relation to these factors.

You might consider recommending the following strategies to help identify the purpose of texts:

* Preview a text before you read to identify sign posts that can help you determine the purpose, audience, and tone
* Use questioning and inferencing to help identify purpose, audience, and tone
* Be aware of logical fallacies and personal biases that can lead to faulty reasoning
* Annotate texts as you read to improve your overall reading comprehension
