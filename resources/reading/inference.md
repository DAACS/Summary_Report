#### Inference

The inference domain assesses students' ability to read closely to determine implied meaning. The primary skill covered by this domain is drawing logical inferences from what texts say explicitly to determine implied meaning. An inference is an educated guess about the implied meaning of a passage or text based on a combination of evidence from the text and reasoning. It is sometimes referred to as "reading between the lines."

You might consider recommending the following strategies to your students to improve their inferencing skills:

* Use sign posts to contextualize what you read and help guide your inferences
* Ask questions before, during, and after reading to improve the accuracy of your inferences
* Be aware of logical fallacies and personal biases that can lead to faulty reasoning and false inferences
* Analyze what a text is trying to say or imply by breaking it down into its major parts
* Annotate texts as you read in order to improve your overall reading comprehension
