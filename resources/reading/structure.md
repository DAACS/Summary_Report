#### Structure

The structure domain assesses students' ability to analyze the structure of ideas in texts. The primary skills covered by this domain are understanding how specific sentences, paragraphs, and larger portions of a text (e.g., a section, chapter, scene, or stanza) relate to each other and the whole; identifying transitional words and phrases used within and between parts of a text; observing sentence-level structures such as punctuation marks used to shape or inflect meaning; and perceiving larger patterns of organization and rhetorical strategies that shape the overall development of ideas in a text (e.g., cause and effect, comparison and contrast, and chronological order).

You might consider recommending the following strategies to improve your ability to analyze the structure of ideas in texts:

* Preview a text before you read to identify sign posts that can help you determine the purpose and structure of the argument
* Analyze the meaning and structure of a text by breaking it down into its major parts
* Identify the pattern of organization used to structure the text
* Visualize the structure of a text by applying tools such as mind maps, outlines, and timelines 
* Annotate texts as you read to improve your overall reading comprehension
