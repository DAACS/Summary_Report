#### Ideas
 
This domain assesses students' ability to identify the main ideas and key supporting details of texts. The primary skills covered by this domain are determining the main ideas or central themes of a text, both explicitly stated and implied; analyzing how specific ideas are supported and developed; and summarizing key supporting details.

The inability to identify main ideas while reading materials for class (e.g., textbook, syllabi, handouts) can lead to a critical failure in understanding course content, formulating intelligent responses, and following instructions.

Select from the following list of strategies to recommend to your students to improve their skills in main  ideas and key supporting details:
* Preview a text before you read to spot sign posts that can help you determine the purpose and structure of the argument.
* Ask questions before, during, and after reading to monitor your reading comprehension and evaluate what you read
* Annotate texts as you read to locate, mark, and reflect upon main ideas and key supporting details
* Paraphrase and summarize what you've read to improve your understanding of it
* Analyze what a text says by breaking it down into its major parts
* Deepen your engagement with the text by comparing/contrasting what it says with other texts and synthesizing your own position
* Visualize what a text says by applying tools such as mind maps, outlines, and timelines
* Follow common reading systems designed to improve reading comprehension
