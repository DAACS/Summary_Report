Self-efficacy is your level of confidence in your ability to do something. Self-efficacy is specific to a certain task so, for example, you might have high self-efficacy for a math test but low self-efficacy for public speaking, or vice versa.

Here are a couple of strategies you could suggest to your students to improve their self-efficacy:
* Use positive self-talk when you encounter difficulties.
* Practice completing assignments and quiz yourself when learning new information.
* Remind yourself of all of the things that you do well in school.
