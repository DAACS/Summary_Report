The reality is that some classes and topics in college can be difficult for students. Further, teachers might not always be able to monitor all their students' progress and check in with everyone about their work. As a result, asking for help when students get stuck or do not understand something is an important survival skill. This is important to remind your students.

Here are some strategies to encourage your students to seek help when they need:
* Identify and write down the specific things that give you trouble, and ask your advisor for suggestions for getting assistance.
* At the start of a course, ask your teacher and advisor about the best way to contact them (e.g., office hours, email, course website, phone call).
* Advocate for yourself -- be persistent if your first attempt to get help is not successful.
