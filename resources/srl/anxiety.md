Test anxiety refers to the experience of negative thoughts (worries and fears), uncomfortable feelings (anxiety), and undesirable physical responses (e.g. increased heart rate) when learners are evaluated in some way. It can occur with many learning activities, including tests.

When learners experience high anxiety, they will often feel “on edge” and avoid activities such as homework or studying, as a result. The experience of learners with low test anxiety is different. While they may feel nervous about a test or project, they do not let this affect their performance because they can effectively manage and control these feelings.

These strategies could be used to cope with anxiety:
* Use relaxation techniques to reduce uncomfortable feelings and to increase your focus, as needed.
* Practice positive self-talk and challenge negative thoughts.
* Create schedules and plan study times so you don't get anxious about being able to do what needs to be done.
