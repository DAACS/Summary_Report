Mindset refers to ones' beliefs about whether their intelligence is fixed or can grow and change over time. It reflects their beliefs about ability in general but not their actual ability.
* A student with a *growth mindset* would likely think, "My intelligence can change with time and effort."
* A student with a *mixed mindset* would likely think, "My intelligence can sometimes change, depending on the situation."
* A student with a *fixed mindset* would likely think, "My intelligence cannot change, no matter what I do."

Suggest one of these strategies to your students to improve their mindset:
* Be aware of your mindset, especially during difficult times
* Practice positive self-talk
* Embrace challenges, and know when to ask for help
